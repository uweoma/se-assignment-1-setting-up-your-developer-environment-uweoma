# Dev_Setup
Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Python installation process
1.	I visited the official Python website and navigated to the “download page”.
2.	I selected the appropriate version of Python which is 3.12.4
3.	I clicked the “download” button and waited for it to finish downloading
4.	Once it finally downloaded, I ran the Python installer by double-clicking on the downloaded file.
5.	I followed the prompts to complete the installation process of which to make sure I selected the option to add python to PATH6
6.	To check the version and also verify if it’s successfully installed, I opened my command prompt and typed python --version


Visual Studio Code instalation process
Download Visual Studio Code:
- I went to the official page to download visual studio code
- I clicked on the Windows download button to download the installer on my windows system.
Run the Installer:
- Once the download was completed, I opened the downloaded .exe file.
- I followed the installation wizard. It prompted me to agree to the license terms and select the installation location.
- I chose some additional tasks such as creating a desktop icon or adding VS Code to the PATH (recommended).
- I clicked on "Install" to begin the installation process.
Launch Visual Studio Code:
- After the installation was completed, I then launched VS Code from the Start menu 

After which I went ahead to dowload Prettier and coderunner to customize my visual studio

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with 
its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.

CHALLENGIES AND HOW I OVERCAME It
I encountered several challengies like:
- In python installation, installation and customization option gave me issues on which to pick
- How to navigate to the PATH encountered.
I was able to overcome by using my best friend(google and youtube)

I'm sorry for the lateness in submission, my screen got broken and I had to fix it by all means.
