its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.

CHALLENGIES AND HOW I OVERCAME It
I encountered several challengies like:
- In python installation, installation and customization option gave me issues on which to pick
- How to navigate to the PATH encountered.
I was able to overcome by using my best friend(google and youtube)

I'm sorry for the lateness in submission, my screen got broken and I had to fix it by all means.
